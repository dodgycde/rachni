# Rachni
A minimal laravel-mix build starter

## Installation
Install is nice and simple. Open a brand new project, and just run:
```
npx dodgycoffee/rachni
```

## Commands
After install is complete, the following build commands will be available:

- `npm run dev` runs the development build step (no minification)
- `npm run prod` runs the production build step (minification, source-maps, etc)
- `npm run watch` runs the watcher. This will monitor files for changes and auto-build development on save

> To add or modify commands, simple edit "scripts" in your package.json file

## FAQ
- **How do I do *specifically* so and so?**
    - It's impossible I quit.
